        <h1>TalkToHomes Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p className="updated">Last updated: November 10, 2025</p>

        <p>
          By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to receive recurring automated
          promotional and personalized marketing text messages (SMS and MMS)
          from TalkToHomes, a brand owned and operated by TalkToHomes. These
          messages may include reminders, offers, or other marketing
          communications and may be sent through an automatic telephone dialing
          system to the mobile number you provided during sign-up or any number
          you later designate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your consent to receive automated text messages is not a condition of
          purchase. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency may
          vary. TalkToHomes reserves the right to adjust delivery frequency at
          any time, which may result in an increase or decrease in the number of
          messages sent. We may also update the sending phone number or short
          code and will notify you if this occurs.

          participating mobile carriers are not responsible for delayed, failed,
          or undelivered messages.

          Messages can typically be delivered to major carriers such as
          AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Sprint, and other national and
          regional providers.
